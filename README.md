# [Antenna for Weather Radios]
During severe weather, espically tornadoes, internet connection is rarely avaliable. These anetnnas allow for connection to your local NWS Transmitter to stay updaated on the weather. 
- These antennas have been designed and built to work best on National Weather Radio transmission frequencies.
- Plug into the antenna socket at the back of Weather Radio in areas of poor reception.
- Hang the top of the antenna with the plastic loop from the ceiling or on a wall.
- Avoid hanging on metal surfaces if possible for best performance.
- Use cable with RCA connectors to extend the placement of the antenna.

# Building
1) Mark the twin-lead antenna points (feedpoint and 1/2 wave point).
